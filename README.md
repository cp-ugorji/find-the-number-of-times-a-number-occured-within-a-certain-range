# find-the-number-of-times-a-number-occured-within-a-certain-range
This project will be checking the number of times a number occured from zero to a certain maximum band/range.
We could use an array or list or simply variables but we intend to read from a file (globaskillstest.txt) which contains 2 numbers, 
i) the number we want to find its number of occurrence (2 in this case) and 
ii) the maximum band/range within which we want to check (35 in this case).

So this application will check the number of times 2 occured from 0 to 35.
